# Current task

Set strict module-owned architecture instructions for all repositories.

## Status

Agent notes and central MCP guidance define modular monoliths, practical DDD, and matching frontend/backend ownership.
Events and queues are optional capabilities. The source-file guideline is 700–900 lines.
No application runtime refactor or new infrastructure was added.
