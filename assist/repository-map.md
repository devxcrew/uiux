# CODEXSUN Repository Map

## Dependency direction

UIUX depends on the public package surface of UI. UI does not depend on UIUX. Application
repositories may use UI, but they must not import UIUX source files or depend on the UIUX web package.

## Repository status

The confirmed repository list was checked with `git ls-remote` on 2026-09-27. Reachability does not
confirm branch policy, visibility, package publication, or application readiness.

## Boundary rule

Changes to UI belong in the UI repository. Changes to framework, platform, core, composition, or an
application belong in that repository. This repository may contain a local proposal only when the
proposal supports a gallery example and does not change an external repository.
